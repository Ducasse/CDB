How to add more resources (CBD examples) to the test class?

- Use a script as the following to generate a little file.

	| cdb maker values result |
	values := { ('aaa' -> 'ami') . ('bal' -> 'balance') . ('c123' -> 'cerise') . ('doul' -> 'dentiste') }.
	maker := CDBCreator new.
	maker start: 'testCerise.cdb'.
	values do: [ :v | maker addKey: v key value: v value ].
	maker finish.

- then turn the file contents into a string using the following for example

(File named: 'testCerise.cdb' asFileName) readStream contents asByteArray base64Encoded



CDB dumpFileOnTranscript: 'myFromPythonImplementation.cdb'.
CDB dumpFileOnTranscript: 'testCerise.cdb'

OldCdbEnumeration new 
	initializeWithByteArray: CDBTest encodedCDBFileContentsPython base64Decoded ;
	dump
